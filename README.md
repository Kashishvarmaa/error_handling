# Error Handling 

This Solidity program demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of  require(), assert(), and revert() of the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to get a feel for how the errors occur when the following function's requirements doesn't get fulfiled.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for basic calculations on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a three functions and among them two of the functions returns the value in the condition. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a template to understand how the errors work on require(), assert(), and revert().thus can be a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., project_1.sol)

wite your code and in order to compile the code, click on the "Solidity Complier" tab on the left hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.10"(or any other compatible version),and then click on the "Compile project_1.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Project_1" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by adding your own numbers and check the message in the compiler, and understand how error handling in solidity occurs and you will observe that the transation is returned to the user if it doesn't occur.
